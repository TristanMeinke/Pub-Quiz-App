== README

This app was programmed collaboratively with github user tstinghen, using Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap.

The demo version presented here is early, but functional.  Future versions will include additional features, additional comments, a more sophisticated user interface and front end, and minor changes to existing code. This version is fully CRUD operational and capable of performing the basic functions it is intended to.
